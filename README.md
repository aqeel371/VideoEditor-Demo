# Video Editoe Demo

This demo showcases a `UICollectionView` that supports zooming, pinch gestures, and drag-and-drop functionality. The app includes three horizontally scrolling collection views, each containing colorful cells. The user can zoom in or out to adjust the visible cell count, dynamically add or remove cells at the zoom location, and drag cells within each collection view.

## Features

- **Zoom and Pinch Gestures**: Adjust the visible cell count by zooming in or out. When zoomed in, cells display labels incrementing by 1 (e.g., 1, 2, 3...), while zoomed-out views increment labels by 5 (e.g., 5, 10, 15...).
- **Dynamic Cell Adjustment**: Cells are added or removed dynamically based on the zoom level, ensuring that the visible range adapts to user interactions.
- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Users can drag cells to reorder them within the collection view.
